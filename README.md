# Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) and Child Speech

## Hello and welcome! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

## Overview

This project was undertaken by **Caroline Gish** for the course project in the Data Science for Linguists 2022 course.

The overall goal of this project was to see how the UDS semantic annotation framework was equipped to handle child speech. 

To read what my classmates had to say about my project during the semester, be sure to visit my [project guestbook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Class-Lounge/blob/main/guestbooks/guestbook_caroline.md)!

Data were sourced from the both the [Decomp repository](https://github.com/decompositional-semantics-initiative/decomp) of the Decompositional Semantics Initiative and the [CHILDES](https://childes.talkbank.org/) child language component of the TalkBank system.
