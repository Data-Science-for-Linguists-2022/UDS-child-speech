    "According to the [published literature on the UDS dataset](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.699.pdf), the values for each attribute come from crowd-sourced annotations. These annotations are binary responses (YES/NO) in response to simple questions about the predicates, and then along with them, there is a 1-5 confidence rating (how confident the annotator feels about their YES or NO answer) that gets normalized. The confidence is the researcher confidence score dealing with how accurate the researcher believes the annotators' responses to be (there will be a lower confidence score if the annotator responses are more variable). Confidence is on [0,1]."
