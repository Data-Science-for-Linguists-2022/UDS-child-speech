**Note on this subdirectory:** Because I used CRC's Open ONDemand interface, I was not able to save my Jupyter Notebooks straight to this subdirectory. What I had to do was  download the notebook in its entirety each time after I made changes. Therefore, there were multiple versions of the notebook. The final version of the notebook is the one in this [`notebooks/`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/tree/main/notebooks) subdirectory (UDS-child-speech/notebooks/), and the old versions are in the [`archived_notebooks`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/tree/main/notebooks/archived_notebooks) subdirectory of this main repo subdirectory (UDS-child-speech/notebooks/archived_notebooks/).
