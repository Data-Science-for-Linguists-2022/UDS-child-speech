# Progress Reports

---

## as of 2022-02-15

- 2 datasets solidified
	- Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) dataset with Decomp toolkit
	- CHILDES Narrative English Hicks Corpus
- project plan written
- read through a few of the transcribed narratives
- currently reading up on how to install Decomp toolkit and use it

## 1st Progress Report

### UDS dataset (with Decomp toolkit) ([notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/uds_initial_exploration.ipynb))

**Overall:** This is a massive dataset, and figuring out how to use the Decomp toolkit has been a bit challenging, so it feels like I have yet to make a dent in the exploration of it. I worked through the Quick Start portion of the documentation and also read through a lot of the documentation (withouth implementing the code) to try to get some context for what I was doing. I expected this part of my project to take more time than I would have before the first progress report. Exploration of the UDS dataset with the Decomp toolkit is one of the main aspects of my project instead of UDS being just a data source. Additionally, because I have not encountered some of the types of linguistic features and analyses before, I am having to do a lot of outside reading in addition to dataset exploration.

**Sharing:** The UDS dataset is comprised of many different datasets and is bundled with the Decomp toolkit, which I have installed using `pip`. All of the individual datasets, though, are located at <http://decomp.io/data/>. 

### CHILDES Narrative English Hicks Corpus ([notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/hicks_initial_exploration.ipynb))

**Overall:** I spent a lot (like *a lot*) of time trying to figure out how to read in and look at *.cha* (CHAT) files which is the format of most of the CHILDES database data. I started out using the `chamd` library from `ChatReader`, but it was not working out the way I wanted to - I couldn't get to the annotations. I eventually came across PyLangAcq, or Language Acquisition Research in Python (not sure how I didn't come across this before `chamd`), and it's a lot easier to work with. Because I spent so much time figuring out how to even get to the CHAT data, I didn't have as much time to put it in the format that I need. This dataset, however, is very clean and in the standardized format of the CHILDES database data. There is lots of documentation about the transcription and annotation processes that I have been reading through.

**Sharing:** ([`data_samples/` directory](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/tree/main/data_samples)) Since all of the data are readily available from the [CHILDES database](https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Hicks.html) and the CHAT files can be viewed on there without having to use additional software, I have chosen to only put files (one from each narrative genre) from one child per grade into my `data_samples/` directory. 

## 2nd Progress Report

### UDS dataset (with Decomp toolkit) ([notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/uds_initial_exploration.ipynb) - this notebook is the same notebook from progress report 1; I have just added to it)

**Overall:** To be open and frank, I have been getting increasingly overwhelmed by the UDS dataset. There is *a lot* of documentation on it, but this also means there is a lot to read through and be overwhelmed by. I ran into an issue where I could no longer load the `decomp` package and import the UDSCorpus, and as this is the first step to doing anything with my dataset, I was both unable to run the previous code I had written and unable to explore the dataset further. I ended up having to update a bunch of individual components of the package, and now I am back on track.

**Specifics:**

- more exploration
- updated packages
- Continued working through the Decomp tutorials (<https://decomp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html>)
- read all about the visualizations and how they work
- attempted to try out some visualizations, but was unable to

**Sharing:** The Decomp Toolkit and UDS Dataset are licensed under the [MIT license by Aaron Steven White](https://github.com/decompositional-semantics-initiative/decomp/blob/master/LICENSE). I have decided to go with the [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/LICENSE.md) license for the code elements of my project. This license is compatible with MIT-licensed software, and I want to make my code publicly available. As I included in my first progress report, the UDS dataset is comprised of many different datasets and is bundled with the Decomp toolkit, so I am accessing it through there, not the individual data files themselves. All of the individual datasets, though, are located at <http://decomp.io/data/>. 

### CHILDES Narrative English Hicks Corpus ([notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/hicks_initial_exploration.ipynb) - this notebook is the same notebook from progress report 1; I have just added to it)

**Overall:** A lot more exploration with PyLangAcq - I made my way through the features offered by the library with my specific dataset. 

**Specifics:**

- more exploration
- figured out I am only really interested in the dependent tiers of the datasets 
- created a dataframe with %mor and %gra tiers for the entire dataset

**Sharing:** I added a CC license to go along with the non-code elements of my project and to align with the licensing on the TalkBank data from which the CHILDES Narrative English corpus comes. The original CHILDES TalkBank data is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license, so I, too, am required to use this same license. As I included in my first progress report, since all of the data are readily available from the [CHILDES database](https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Hicks.html) and the CHAT files can be viewed on there without having to use additional software, I have chosen to only put files (one from each narrative genre) from one child per grade into my [`data_samples/` directory](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/tree/main/data_samples).
