## as of 2022-02-15

- 2 datasets solidified
	- Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) dataset with Decomp toolkit
	- CHILDES Narrative English Hicks Corpus
- project plan written
- read through a few of the transcribed narratives
- currently reading up on how to install Decomp toolkit and use it

## 1st Progress Report

### UDS dataset (with Decomp toolkit) ([notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/uds_initial_exploration.ipynb))

**Overall:** This is a massive dataset, and figuring out how to use the Decomp toolkit has been a bit challenging, so it feels like I have yet to make a dent in the exploration of it. I worked through the Quick Start portion of the documentation and also read through a lot of the documentation (withouth implementing the code) to try to get some context for what I was doing. I expected this part of my project to take more time than I would have before the first progress report. Exploration of the UDS dataset with the Decomp toolkit is one of the main aspects of my project instead of UDS being just a data source. Additionally, because I have not encountered some of the types of linguistic features and analyses before, I am having to do a lot of outside reading in addition to dataset exploration.

**Sharing:** The UDS dataset is comprised of many different datasets and is bundled with the Decomp toolkit, which I have installed using `pip`. All of the individual datasets, though, are located at <http://decomp.io/data/>. 

### CHILDES Narrative English Hicks Corpus ([notebook](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/blob/main/hicks_initial_exploration.ipynb))

**Overall:** I spent a lot (like *a lot*) of time trying to figure out how to read in and look at *.cha* (CHAT) files which is the format of most of the CHILDES database data. I started out using the `chamd` library from `ChatReader`, but it was not working out the way I wanted to - I couldn't get to the annotations. I eventually came across PyLangAcq, or Language Acquisition Research in Python (not sure how I didn't come across this before `chamd`), and it's a lot easier to work with. Because I spent so much time figuring out how to even get to the CHAT data, I didn't have as much time to put it in the format that I need. This dataset, however, is very clean and in the standardized format of the CHILDES database data. There is lots of documentation about the transcription and annotation processes that I have been reading through.

**Sharing:** ([`data_samples/` directory](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/UDS-child-speech/tree/main/data_samples)) Since all of the data are readily available from the [CHILDES database](https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Hicks.html) and the CHAT files be viewed on there without having to use additional software, I have chosen to only put files (one from each narrative genre) from one child per grade into my `data_samples/` directory.
