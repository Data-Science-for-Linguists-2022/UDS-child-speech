    "\"In this line of work, we propose a novel framework for capturing linguistic expressions of generalization. We suggest that linguistic expressions of generalization should be captured in a continuous multi-label system, rather than a multi-class system. We do this by decomposing categories such as EPISODIC, HABITUAL, and GENERIC into simple referential properties of predicates and their arguments.\"\n",
