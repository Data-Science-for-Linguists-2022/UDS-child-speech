Looking through the %cod tier and comparing it against the coding scheme (Coding 1.1 section of https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Hicks.html), I do not see much evidence that the researchers followed through with this path of exploration.\n",

It’s most likely so prevalent because of the nature of the task (getting kids to talk about something they have just watched) and probably has something to do with the kids not wanting to say something actually happened with certainty because they only witnessed what happened in a video, not in real life. \n",
